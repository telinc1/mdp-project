## Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug in the project, please help us by reporting it. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Check if the bug has already been reported by searching the issue tracker.
2. If the bug hasn't been reported, create a new issue with a descriptive title and detailed information about the bug, including:
    - A clear and concise description of the bug.
    - Steps to reproduce the bug.
    - Expected behavior.
    - Screenshots or code snippets, if applicable.

## Fixing a bug

Open a new GitHub pull request. Ensure the description clearly describes the problem and solution.

We use the [GitHub Flow](https://githubflow.github.io) as our branching strategy.

### Testing

Ensure that your changes do not break existing functionality by running unit tests.
Fix any test failures or errors and make necessary adjustments before submitting your pull request.

### Style guidelines

We use [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) to define and enforce coding styles.
Before contributing, make sure to check that your code editor supports EditorConfig,
and follow the project's `.editorconfig` file for consistent indentation, line endings,
and other formatting rules. If your editor doesn't support EditorConfig by default,
you can find plugins or extensions for most popular editors [here](https://editorconfig.org/#download).

We use Flake8 to enforce coding standards and identify potential issues the code.
Fix any warnings or errors reported by Flake8 before submitting your pull request.
